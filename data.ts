The FY 2025 Budget Request includes
$7.618 billion for the Deep Space
Exploration Systems account. This funding
directly supports the Moon to Mars (M2M)
Program, which is focused on returning
humans to the Moon, conducting pioneering
research and technology development
activities on the lunar surface, and enabling
eventual missions to Mars and beyond. In
collaboration with its commercial and
international partners, NASA will create the
capabilities necessary to sustainably explore
high priority destinations on the lunar
surface, including in-situ science and
resource utilization, surface transportation,
and habitation capabilities. The operational
knowledge, technological advances, and
scientific discoveries NASA gains from
exploring the Moon in collaboration with international and commercial partners will position the agency
to take the next giant leap — sending astronauts to Mars and returning them safely back to Earth.

DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION SYSTEMS
The Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (ESDMD) will leverage the Science Mission
Directorate's development of smaller landers for capabilities such as navigation and precision landing of
cargo and data about the lunar surface. ESDMD will also leverage technological investments to prove and
verify concepts through the Space Technology Mission Directorate's lunar exploration activities. Finally,
ESDMD will leverage the Space Operations Mission Directorate's capabilities, such as ISS and the Space
Communications and Navigation Program, as a technology and human system testbed and
communication capability provider, respectively.
The FY 2025 President’s Budget Request manifest supports an Artemis II mission in September 2025,
Artemis III mission in September 2026, Artemis IV mission in September 2028, and Artemis V mission
in 2030 with subsequent flights on a yearly basis.
The Deep Space Exploration Systems account consists of three themes which provide for the
development of systems and capabilities needed for human exploration of deep space:
• M2M Transportation System;
• M2M Lunar Systems Development; and
• Human Exploration Requirements & Architecture (HERA).
M2M Transportation System programs work together to develop three of the key space transportation
systems that will enable the agency’s Artemis Campaign to land the first woman and first person of color
on the Moon and extend human presence into the solar system. The systems being developed are the
Orion crew vehicle, Space Launch System (SLS) launch vehicle, and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS).
The first uncrewed launch of SLS and Orion occurred in November 2022 and the first launch returning
humans to the lunar vicinity in fifty years will occur September 2025.
• The Orion Program is developing the spacecraft which will carry crew to deep space, sustaining the
crew during space travel, providing emergency abort capability, and providing safe re-entry from
deep space return velocities for Artemis missions.
• The SLS Program is developing the human-rated launch system capable of sending the crewed Orion
spacecraft to the Moon, which will be used in each of the Artemis missions.
• The EGS Program is responsible for developing and operating the systems and facilities necessary to
process, integrate, transport, and launch NASA’s SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and any co-
manifested SLS payloads for Artemis missions.
M2M Lunar Systems Development is developing the systems that will be used to land humans on the
Moon, explore the lunar surface, and prepare for Mars exploration. The theme is developing and testing
prototype systems and planning flight missions to the Moon to develop systems and operational practices
that will enable an eventual mission to Mars. M2M Lunar Systems Development is comprised of four
programs: Gateway; Exploration Extravehicular Activity (xEVA) and Human Surface Mobility Program
(EHP); Human Landing System (HLS); and Advanced Exploration Systems (AES). The work done by
these programs work will create the exploration infrastructure in lunar orbit and on the lunar surface that
astronauts will utilize during Artemis missions and that will inform future missions to Mars.
• Gateway is a platform that will orbit the Moon and support orbital activities, lunar landers, and
surface activities. Gateway will initially consist of a Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the
Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO); with later configurations including at least two modules
contributed by NASA’s international partners; and may be supported by U.S. commercial logistics
services.
DEEP SPACE EXPLORATION SYSTEMS
• EHP is formulating the systems that NASA will use to explore the surface of the Moon. These surface
systems include: the Lunar Terrain Vehicle; the Pressurized Rover; and xEVA surface suits;
providing lessons learned and expertise that will support future Mars missions.
• HLS utilizes commercial partnerships to develop and jointly deploy the integrated landing system that
will transport crew to and from the lunar surface and conduct a series of lunar missions using that
capability. The budget provides funding for the HLS Program to maintain competition for lunar
landing services by supporting the development of multiple different lunar landing systems.
• AES will continue work to identify and address knowledge gaps and deliver fundamental capabilities
to provide astronauts a place to live and work with integrated life support systems, radiation
protection, food, fire safety, avionics and software, logistics management, and waste management
systems.
HERA is identifying the exploration infrastructure required for Artemis missions that will inform future
missions to Mars. It also works to ensure that lunar exploration systems are extensible to Mars
exploration where technically feasible and cost-effective. HERA is comprised of the Strategy &
Architecture Office (SAO) and Future Systems.
• SAO manages the architecture strategy activity that supports mission manifest planning and overall
architecture requirements and capability identification.
• Future Systems is conducting trade studies to reduce risk and identify required technologies to be
utilized as part of the Artemis Campaign and act as precursor systems for future missions to Mars.
EXPLANATION OF MAJOR CHANGES IN FY 2025
To fully implement the Moon to Mars Program Office concept and effectively manage content across the
M2M portfolio, the following changes are being proposed:
• Rename Common Exploration Systems Development as M2M Transportation System;
• Rename Artemis Campaign Development as M2M Lunar Systems Development;
• Retire the Advanced Cislunar and Surface Capabilities (ACSC) program, with all follow-on M2M
Integration, Moon & Mars Architecture, and Future Systems content previously in program being re-
aligned to appropriate programs;
• Establish Future Systems as a stand-alone program under HERA theme;
• Rename Moon & Mars Architecture as Strategy and Architecture Office (SAO);
• Rename Exploration Capabilities as Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) and move to M2M Lunar
Systems Development theme;
• Retire the Mars Campaign Development theme; and
• M2M Program Office and integration funding have been re-aligned across the M2M themes.

The Space Operations account is dedicated to
sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit
(LEO), enabling future exploration and advanced
operations in our solar system, and advancing
scientific discoveries that benefit life on Earth. In
the near term, this includes support of
International Space Station (ISS) operations and
research, while laying the foundation for America
to develop and maintain a commercial economy
in LEO. This budget request continues to prepare
for a smooth transition in 2030 from ISS
operations to new LEO destinations that are
commercially owned and operated and to safely
deorbit the ISS.
Space Operations is comprised of four themes:
• ISS;
• Space Transportation;
• Space and Flight Support; and
• Commercial LEO Development.

Moghbeli (right), pose for a portrait while installing
helmet lights on spacesuits and checking the functionality
of their spacesuit's components - (October 27, 2023).
SPACE OPERATIONS
Collectively, these themes are developing and operating American-led space infrastructure enabled by a
commercial market, enhancing space access and services to both government and commercial entities,
and researching and developing capabilities to safeguard astronaut explorers. These activities, which
support existing and future space operations for both NASA and non-NASA missions, are catalysts for
economic development and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in LEO in which NASA is one of
many customers for commercial services. Additionally, these activities continue to return medical and
environmental benefits to humanity, advance scientific knowledge, and foster new technologies that
improve American lives.
ISS continues to demonstrate American leadership in global space exploration, enabling a U.S.-led
multinational partnership to advance shared goals in space. As a testbed for deep space exploration, ISS is
helping us learn how to keep astronauts healthy during long-duration space travel and demonstrating
technologies for human and robotic exploration beyond LEO, to the Moon, and to Mars. The ISS:
• Promotes commerce in space as new commercialization concepts are explored and stimulates
non-NASA demand to support development of commercial destinations under the Commercial LEO
Development Program;
• Enables scientists to identify and quantify risks to human health and performance, develop
countermeasures, and develop and test technologies that protect astronauts during extended human
space exploration;
• Supports NASA research and development in the areas of biological and physical science, as well as
Earth and space science missions;
• Conducts research to benefit humanity through the ISS National Lab;
• Continues American leadership in low-Earth orbit in the face of increased human spaceflight activity
by foreign competitors; and
• Maintains the ISS international partnership that has brought together astronauts and scientists from
dozens of spacefaring nations in peaceful and cooperative activity.
Space Transportation’s objective is to transport U.S. Orbital Segment (USOS) astronauts and cargo safely
to and from space, including the ISS. Working with industry to develop and provide human transportation
services to and from space lays the foundation for more affordable and sustainable future human space
transportation. These commercial partnerships bolster American leadership in space, have ended sole
reliance on foreign providers for crew transportation services, help stimulate the American aerospace
industry, and allow NASA to focus on building the capabilities and expertise necessary for missions to
the Moon and Mars. This theme includes the Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and Crew and Cargo
Program, which includes the ISS U.S. Deorbit Vehicle (USDV).
• The CCP partners with the U.S. commercial sector to develop and operate safe, reliable, and
affordable crew transportation systems capable of carrying humans to and from the ISS and other
LEO destinations. Working with industry to develop and provide human transportation services to
and from space lays the foundation for more affordable and sustainable future human space
transportation.
• The Crew and Cargo Program manages transportation services provided by both international
partners and domestic commercial providers. Through the program, NASA has greatly strengthened
U.S. competitiveness by awarding ISS cargo resupply contracts to multiple vendors, as well as
continuing to advance commercial spaceflight and support American jobs. The Crew and Cargo
Program also includes funding for the ISS USDV that will be competitively awarded to U.S. industry.
SPACE OPERATIONS
The Space and Flight Support Theme (SFS) continues to provide mission critical space communication
and navigation services, launch and test services, and astronaut training to support its customer missions.
The theme is comprised of the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program,
Communications Services Program, Launch Services Program, Rocket Propulsion Test Program, Human
Space Flight Operations Program, and Human Research Program.
• The SCaN Program provides communication to missions in LEO, including ISS, suborbital missions,
and some lunar orbital missions, utilizing the Near Space Network. The Deep Space Network
communicates with missions most distant from Earth and will initially provide primary
communication links to early Artemis missions. SCaN is planning for expanded services for missions
to the Moon, including lunar relay capability for missions that cannot communicate directly with
Earth and enhanced position, navigation, and timing services that are less dependent on tracking
stations on Earth.
• The Communications Services Program focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of using
commercially provided satellite communications (SATCOM) services to support NASA missions
near Earth.
• The Launch Services Program provides expertise and active launch mission management for more
than 70 NASA and other government missions in various stages of development.
• The Rocket Propulsion Test Program manages a wide range of facilities capable of ground testing
rocket engines and components under controlled conditions.
• The Human Space Flight Operations Program provides the training and readiness to ensure crew
health and safety and mission success.
• The Human Research Program improves astronauts' ability to collect data, solve problems, respond to
emergencies, and remain healthy during and after extended space travel.
NASA's Commercial LEO Development effort focuses on the development of a robust commercial space
economy in LEO. It is stimulating development of commercially owned and operated LEO destinations
from which NASA can purchase services to meet enduring LEO human spaceflight and research
requirements. The program:
• Ensures NASA can meet its needs in LEO as it transitions in 2030 from ISS operations to new LEO
destinations that are commercially owned and operated. NASA’s future requirements that will persist
beyond the lifetime of the ISS include crew accommodation and training, human research, physical
and biological research, technology demonstration and science, and a National Laboratory;
• Prepares for a sustained human presence in LEO and U.S. leadership in LEO after the ISS;
• Ensures the capability to maintain an American presence in LEO;
• Drives down costs through LEO commercialization so NASA can free up resources to be used for
future human space operations and exploration; and
• Utilizes inventive, non-traditional agreements for acquiring commercial space goods and services to
meet NASA requirements.
The budget funds ISS operations and research, a vehicle to safely de-orbit ISS after it is retired in 2030,
and commercial space stations that NASA will use as soon as they become available. The budget
gradually reduces research and other activities on board the ISS in the outyears, beginning in FY 2026, to
provide the funding necessary for USDV development and Commercial LEO Development efforts. As a
SPACE OPERATIONS
result of this budget re-balancing, an assessment will be carried out to determine the full trade space of
potential changes needed to meet outyear funding levels; such options should include discussion of
reducing the number of science payloads/investigations to ISS and/or decreasing the number of astronauts
on board the USOS, among other options.

space activities more effective, affordable, and sustainable. In FY 2025, STMD plans to issue over
300 grants similar to prior fiscal years.
• Early Career Initiative engages the early-career NASA workforce in the management and
development of two-year, $2.5 million technology projects. In addition to providing leadership
opportunities for the early-career NASA workforce, it also helps build and maintain unique skillsets
in support of NASA missions. In FY 2025, STMD expects to have nine active awards, an increase of
four over FY 2023.
• Center Innovations Fund provides low-cost seed funding to develop new technologies and capabilities
at all NASA centers including Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Partnerships with academia, industry, other
NASA centers, as well as other government agencies are encouraged. In FY 2025, STMD plans to
grant over 120 awards, about 20 awards fewer than FY 2023.
• NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts nurtures highly innovative, visionary ideas that could one day
change the possible in aerospace over the next 10 to 20 plus years. In FY 2025, STMD expects about
38 active awards, an increase of about 20 over FY 2023.
• Prizes, Challenges, and Crowdsourcing conducts public-facing challenges in support of all NASA
mission directorates, addressing several agency priorities. Using a wide variety of avenues, including
the NASA Tournament Lab, NASA@WORK, and Centennial Challenges, nearly every U.S. state has
provided solutions. In FY 2025, STMD is planning for nearly 50 new awards, similar to prior years.
• Early-Stage Innovation and Commerce provides the ability for ESIP programs to jointly explore
innovative methods to increase the impact of NASA early-stage technology development. Examples
include innovative pilots including enhanced support to underrepresented communities, evidence-
driven programs, academic research to market, and partnerships. In FY 2025, STMD is planning for
10 awards, similar to prior fiscal years.
• Technology Transfer provides agency-level management and oversight of NASA-developed and
NASA-owned intellectual property and manages the transfer of these technologies to external entities.
NASA is seeking to accelerate commercialization through entrepreneurial initiatives and
partnerships. In FY 2025, STMD has the goal to manage over 5,000 patents and software use
agreements and to increase technology transfer activities to all NASA centers.
Technology Maturation
• Game Changing Development (GCD) aims to advance exploratory concepts and deliver transition-
ready solutions that enable new capabilities or radically alter current approaches such as High
Performance Spaceflight Computing. GCD advances a broad range of mid-TRL technologies,
including in the areas of entry, descent, and landing (e.g., Safe and Precise Landing – Integrated
Capabilities Evolution and Dragonfly Entry Aerosciences Measurements (DrEAM); power and
energy storage (e.g., Tipping Points In-Situ Resource Utilization [ISRU] power on the Moon and
Harmonia Radioisotope power supply); propulsion systems (e.g., Liquid Oxygen/Liquid Hydrogen
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
demonstration engine Announcement of Collaboration Opportunity); materials and structures (e.g.,
Superlight Aerospace Components); and robotic systems (e.g., ISRU Pilot Excavator).
• Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative develops transformative capabilities for lunar surface exploration
across the Space Technology portfolio. Focus areas include in-situ resource utilization, sustainable
surface power, excavation and construction, dust mitigation, and ability to operate in extreme
environments. The Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium brings together NASA, universities,
industry, non-profits, and other government agencies to ensure the United States is the leader in
sustainable lunar exploration. In FY 2025, STMD expects to continue to mature technologies critical
for a sustained human presence on the Moon. For example, the Moon-to-Mars Planetary Autonomous
Construction Technologies (MMPACT) will utilize lunar in-situ materials for the on-demand
construction of large-scale infrastructure elements such as habitats, berms, landing pads, and blast
shields. Lunar Infrastructure Foundational Technologies (LIFT-1) will be an ISRU lunar surface
demonstration of oxygen extraction technologies from lunar regolith for eventual production, capture,
and storage of oxygen on the lunar surface.
Technology Demonstration (TDM)
TDM matures crosscutting system-level technologies through demonstration in operational environments.
Examples of projects in TDM include high-power solar electric propulsion; cryogenic fluid management;
sustainable lunar surface power; and space nuclear propulsion. These technologies are critical for a long-
term, sustainable presence on the Moon and deep space exploration.
• The Solar Electric Propulsion Project seeks to develop and qualify an advanced 12 kilowatt-class
Electric Propulsion thruster applicable to exploration and commercial spaceflight, and the
Qualification System Acceptance Review 1 is planned for FY 2025.
• The Eta Space CFM Tipping Point launch is scheduled for November 2024 and the United Launch
Alliance CFM Tipping Point launch readiness review is planned for July 2025.
• Research in both Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) and Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) will
enable robust and reliable energy to both human and scientific exploration missions.
o Subscale integrated NEP concept design is targeted for completion in FY 2025
o Final design and initial fabrication of a high-power electric thruster that could be used in a NEP
system will be delivered in FY 2025
o NASA is partnering with DARPA on a cislunar demonstration of NTP technologies, planned for
FY 2027, and the mission Critical Design Review is scheduled in early FY 2025
Flight Opportunities (FO) and Small Spacecraft Technology (SST) will continue to increase the pace of
space exploration and discovery by leveraging small spacecraft and responsive launch capabilities. By
2025, the 12 current SST demonstrations, including the Starling mission and space traffic management
experiment currently on orbit, will be completed. In FY 2024, SST is evaluating four industry-led mission
concept studies for transition to one or more orbital demonstrations. During FY 2025, those new missions
will be undergoing rapid hardware development in preparation for a target launch before the end of 2026.
In FY 2025, FO anticipates using newly awarded Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)
contracts to continue its rapid pace of technology demonstrate activities in partnership with the U.S.
commercial space transportation industry.
SPACE TECHNOLOGY
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR)
SBIR and STTR will continue efforts to encourage participation of underrepresented groups across the
nation to expand inclusive innovation. In FY 2025, STMD plans to select over 600 new awards, grants,
and contracts to small businesses, as well as continue to incubate and mature NASA commercial
partnerships through post Phase II activities through sequential Phase II awards. Additionally, STMD will
pilot ways to reduce barriers to entry and streamline the experience throughout the program phases,
including strategies to encourage transition to NASA, government, and/or commercial use beyond
SBIR/STTR awards.

NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) conducts
scientific exploration enabled by space-based
observatories, which observe the Earth, perform
fundamental research, visit other bodies in the solar
system, and gaze out into the galaxy and beyond.
NASA's scientific exploration will inform human
exploration of the Moon, Mars, and the solar system,
providing valuable scientific data for such human
missions. NASA also strives to drive discovery by
studying biological and physical phenomena in space.
SMD utilizes technological advances and partnership
opportunities, including public-private partnerships that
leverage commercial investments to further NASA's
science objectives.
NASA’s science programs also help protect and
improve life on Earth through research that enables
innovative and practical applications for decision-
makers, including disaster response, natural resource
management, and planetary defense.
SMD uses the recommendations of the National
Academies’ decadal surveys as important inputs in
planning and prioritizing the future of its science
programs. SMD uses these recommendations to
prioritize future flight missions (including space observatories and probes), as well as technology
development and proposals for theoretical and suborbital supporting research.
This massive Wolf-Rayet star, WR 124, is 15,000
light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
It is 30 times the mass of the Sun and has shed 10
Suns worth of material so far. As the ejected gas
moves away from the star and cools, cosmic dust
forms and glows in the infrared light, detectable
by the James Webb Space Telescope.
SCIENCE
The current decadal surveys informing mission priorities include the Decadal Survey for Earth Science
and Applications from Space 2018 to 2027; the Origins, Worlds, and Life: A Decadal Strategy for
Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032; the Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and
Astrophysics for the 2020s; and the Decadal Survey on Biological and Physical Sciences Research in
Space 2023-2032. The Heliophysics Division is expecting an updated decadal in 2024.
In determining the content of the Science portfolio, NASA also considers national priorities and policies,
budgets, existing technological capabilities, partnership opportunities, and other programmatic factors.
EXPLANATION OF MAJOR CHANGES IN FY 2025
The Budget provides $7.6 billion for Science, a $229.3 million decrease from the FY 2023 enacted level.
Within Earth Science, NASA is restructuring missions within the Earth System Observatory. The
Atmosphere Observing System (AOS) missions will be restructured to retain the partnership with JAXA
on their Precipitation Measurement Mission, formerly part of AOS-Storm. NASA is assessing options for
implementing the remainder of the Aerosol and Cloud, Convection, and Precipitation designated
observables. Similarly, the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission will be split into two projects,
Surface Biology and Geology (SBG)-Thermal Infrared (TIR) and SBG-hyperspectral visible to shortwave
infrared (VSWIR), to maximize execution flexibility and reduce near-term budget requirements. The
Budget provides $150 million for Landsat Next. NASA will not be able to reliably estimate the launch
readiness date until there is a final FY 2024 appropriation, but expects the launch date to be delayed
compared to the prior estimate of CY 2030. NASA has established a new Responsive Science Initiatives
program in Earth Science. This program consolidates and enhances current activities within Earth Science
to increase the impact of NASA’s observations, Earth system science, and applied science by aligning,
scaling and connecting with user needs.
Within Planetary Science, given that the Mars Sample Return mission is a major part of NASA's
Planetary Science budget, the Budget enables NASA's internal assessment of mission architecture options
to be completed to address increases in mission cost estimates before providing final details for the $2.7
billion Planetary Science budget. Based on this ongoing assessment, the funding levels for Planetary
Science missions are subject to change.
The budget proposes an updated profile for the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor mission to support a
June 2028 launch readiness date. NASA has also increased the Dragonfly budget request, consistent with
the updated mission cost estimate expected to be reviewed at the upcoming mission confirmation, and
consistent with a launch readiness date of July 2028. Given the need to increase the Dragonfly budget,
NASA has delayed the New Frontiers 5 Announcement of Opportunity (AO) from November 2023 to no
earlier than 2026. This budget request also extends the New Horizons mission until the spacecraft exits
the Kuiper Belt in the 2028 to 2029 timeframe. NASA has also significantly expanded support for the
ESA Rosalind Franklin ExoMars Rover mission in the wake of Russia's exit from the mission.
Within Astrophysics, the budget supports increased investment in the Habitable Worlds Observatory
Technology Maturation project, in direct alignment with the Great Observatories Mission and Technology
Maturation Program (GOMAP) recommendation in the Astro2020 Decadal Survey. NASA has reduced
the Explorer Future missions budget which will preclude the selection of Missions of Opportunity for the

Themes
NASA’s Science budget, managed by SMD, includes five major science areas.
EARTH SCIENCE
NASA’s unique capabilities as a space and science agency ultimately enable decision makers to address
the most pressing challenges posed by our rapidly changing planet such as changing agricultural
conditions, and severe weather challenges, including droughts, tropical storms, and wildfires. NASA
develops innovations in instrument, flight, data, and mission technology to improve capability, resolution,
and frequency of our remote sensing and in-situ Earth observations. NASA missions use the vantage
point of space to observe our planet and continuously improve our scientific understanding of Earth’s
interconnected systems, from Earth’s core to its atmosphere. Missions include continuity measurements
made for decades, and advances in observations to advance understanding of the Earth system. NASA
selects and funds innovative research enabling the nation’s scientific community to build an
ever-improving understanding of global-scale changes, connecting causes to effects.
This budget supports translating Earth science into actionable data and information via investments in
Applied Sciences, which will support applications and user engagement related to disaster response,
wildfires, environmental justice, energy, and agriculture. NASA will work jointly with the Environmental
SCIENCE
Protection Agency and other agencies to integrate greenhouse gas data from a variety of sources with a
goal of making data more accessible to federal, state, and local governments, as well as other users.
Visualization of the information and partnerships in a comprehensive Earth system framework will be
enabled by open science and cutting-edge data science techniques. NASA will continue development of
the Earth Information Center, a physical and virtual space that provides easily accessible, readily usable,
and scalable Earth information – enabling global understanding of the Earth system.
The budget supports continued formulation of the Earth System Observatory missions and Landsat Next,
continues the Earth System Explorers program, and supports sustained climate observations. The budget
also supports the ongoing development of multiple missions in development within the Earth Venture
element. The Applied Sciences program will continue to leverage Earth Science satellite measurements
and new scientific knowledge to enable innovative and practical uses by public and private sector
organizations, including expanded applications development work in support of agriculture.
PLANETARY SCIENCE
To answer questions about the solar system and the origins of life, NASA sends robotic space probes to
the Moon, other planets and their moons, asteroids and comets, and the icy bodies beyond Neptune.
NASA is operating spacecraft at Mars, Jupiter, and the Moon. NASA is preparing to deliver new
instruments to the lunar surface; will launch the Europa Clipper mission to explore Jupiter's moon,
Europa; will develop the Dragonfly mission to explore Saturn's moon, Titan; and will send two missions
to explore Venus. The budget funds the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program that supports Artemis
science, commercial collaborations, and innovative approaches to achieving human and science
exploration goals. The budget supports future competitive mission selections within Discovery and New
Frontiers and a robust research program to support the scientists who use NASA mission data to make
discoveries about our solar system.
The budget supports the Open Source Science initiative, an SMD-wide activity that advances open
science, supports data science innovation, and increases the accessibility of scientific data through the
development of efficient data and computing system capabilities for all SMD divisions.
ASTROPHYSICS
NASA stands on the threshold of new endeavors that will transform not only our understanding of the
universe and the processes and physical paradigms that govern it, but also humanity’s place in it. Progress
in understanding pathways to habitable worlds, opening new windows on the dynamic universe, and
unveiling the drivers of galaxy growth require the essential vantage point of space. Building on the
revolutionary advances in our observations of exoplanets, NASA now seeks to identify and characterize
Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, with the ultimate goal of obtaining imaging and
spectroscopy of potentially habitable worlds.
NASA aims to exploit the new observational tools of gravitational waves and particles, along with
temporal monitoring of the sky across the electromagnetic spectrum and wide-area surveys to probe the
most energetic processes in the universe and address the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and
cosmological inflation. By linking observations and modeling of the stars, galaxies, and the gas and
energetic processes that couple their formation, evolution, and destinies, NASA can revolutionize our
understanding of the origins and evolution of galaxies, from the nature of the tenuous cosmic webs of gas
that feed them, to the nature of how this gas condenses and drives the formation of stars.
SCIENCE
The budget supports operation of the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope, as
well as the development of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Within the Explorers program, the
budget includes funding for SPHEREx and initial selections of the first Astrophysics Probe mission. This
budget expands precursor science and technology efforts in planning and preparing for the GOMAP
recommendation contained in the Astro2020 Decadal Survey.
HELIOPHYSICS
The Sun, a typical small star midway through its life, governs our solar system. The Sun wields its
influence through its gravity, radiation, solar wind, and magnetic fields, all of which interact with the
Earth and its space environment. These processes are crucial for our understanding of the universe, and
they relate directly to our ability to live in space as they produce space weather, which can affect
technological infrastructure and human activities in space. Using a fleet of sensors on various spacecraft
in Earth orbit and throughout the heliosphere, NASA seeks to understand the fundamental processes of
how and why the Sun varies in many ways, how Earth and our solar system respond to the Sun, how the
Sun and the solar system interact with the interstellar medium, and how human activities are affected by
these processes. The science of heliophysics, including space weather, enables the predictions necessary
to safeguard life and society on Earth and the outward journeys of human and robotic explorers.
The budget supports the development of the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, the Carruthers
Geocorona Observatory, and a competitive Explorers Program, including the recently selected Multi-slit
Solar Explorer and HelioSwarm missions. The budget increases funding for the Space Weather program,
which is focused on applied research and applications to enable the nation to better protect our technology
and astronauts from space weather. The budget includes funding for the Diversify, Realize, Integrate,
Venture, Educate initiative and funds orbital debris investments to enable characterization of the
populations of small debris and dust in space to protect space-based critical infrastructure and humans
working in space.
BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES
NASA is a leader in performing fundamental biological and physical sciences research that contributes to
transformational discoveries, improves life on Earth and in space, and enables sustained deep-space
human exploration. NASA achieves this by pioneering research to understand how spaceflight affects
living and physical systems in space and to prepare for future human exploration missions far from Earth.
The experiments NASA conducts on the ISS and other platforms examine how astronauts, plants,
animals, and physical systems respond to the extreme conditions of space, including microgravity,
ionizing radiation, and altered atmosphere.
NASA examines processes of metabolism, reproduction, and development and studies how organisms
repair cellular damage and protect themselves from infection and disease in the conditions of deep space.
In addition to providing useful information on how living organisms respond and adapt to spaceflight, the
discoveries NASA makes in space have significant implications for life on Earth.
NASA also conducts research to understand the fundamental laws of the universe, including quantum
science, and determine how physical systems react in spaceflight environments. This research provides
basic scientific knowledge and results leading to societal benefit, including contributions to the
fundamental understanding of underlying space exploration technologies, such as power generation,
storage, and fuel transfer; space propulsion; life support systems; and environmental monitoring and
control. NASA research also contributes to scientific discoveries in novel areas, such as the fifth state of
SCIENCE
matter, known as Bose-Einstein Condensates, material sciences, and soft matter. This physical sciences
research has led to improved space systems and new products on Earth.

NASA Aeronautics Mission Directorate (ARMD)
leads the nation’s aviation community in research to
maintain and advance American leadership in
aviation. ARMD is working to improve efficiency
and reduce the noise and emissions of commercial
aircraft; advance the safety, capacity, and efficiency
of air transportation; and enhance aviation as an
economic engine. The Aviation sector is critical to
the U.S. economy providing a positive
manufacturing trade balance of $51 million in 2021
and 2.1 million aerospace/defense jobs.
ARMD is working to enable transformation of future
air travel in at least four major areas.
• Ultra-Efficient Airliners: NASA is committed to
supporting the U.S. climate goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation
sector by 2050. Under the Sustainable Flight National Partnership (SFNP), NASA is leading Federal
agencies and industry to accelerate the development of sustainable technologies. The Advanced Air
Vehicle Program (AAVP), Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP), and Airspace Operations
and Safety Program (AOSP) execute the SFNP activities.
• High-Speed Commercial Flight: NASA's Quesst mission will demonstrate that supersonic aircraft (X-
59) can fly without generating loud sonic booms and survey what people hear when it flies overhead.
Reaction to the quieter sonic "thumps" will be shared with regulators who will then consider writing
new rules to lift the ban on faster-than-sound flight over land. AAVP and IASP execute the Quesst
mission.

AERONAUTICS
• Future Airspace and Safety: NASA is working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
industry, and academia to transform air traffic management systems to safely accommodate the
growing demand of new air vehicles entering the airspace, enabling them to perform a variety of
missions no matter what airspace that mission may require. AOSP executes the future airspace
activities.
• Advanced Air Mobility (AAM): NASA's AAM mission will help emerging aviation markets safely
grow and integrate into the air transportation system, moving people and cargo between places
previously not served or underserved by aviation, using revolutionary new aircraft and operational
concepts that are only just now becoming possible thanks to converging technologies. AAM
management technologies will be leveraged to improve responses to wildfires. AOSP and AAVP
execute the AAM mission.
In addition to research that directly aligns with the four major transformation areas, ARMD conducts
foundational research on crosscutting ideas and technologies. This research enables a broad range of
aeronautics and aerospace applications and explores opportunities for technology convergence from
disparate technology areas. Flight and ground capabilities for experimentation and feasibility
demonstrations are additional elements that support the entire ARMD portfolio.
ARMD guides these transformation efforts through a strategic implementation plan. The plan lays out
NASA’s approach to addressing the three key drivers of aviation transformation: the growing demand for
global air mobility; energy efficiency and environmental sustainability; and the opportunity for
convergence between traditional aeronautical disciplines and technology advances in information
technology, communications, energy, and other rapidly evolving technologies. The strategic
implementation plan identifies six research thrusts to comprehensively address the three key drivers.

releases-newest-vision-for-flight-research/
EXPLANATION OF MAJOR CHANGES IN FY 2025
NASA adjusted funding for elements of the SFNP. The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project is being
allocated increased funding as the X-66 aircraft moves into the design/build phase. Funding for the
Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstrations project is being decreased as it completes the build phase.
Additionally, funding for the Hi-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM) project is being
increased by more than previously planned to enable the completion of major ground tests of both a wing
and fuselage component.
NASA increased funding for the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator (LBFD) to cover rebaselined
commitments for cost and schedule. The project was rebaselined due to poor contractor performance and
COVID impacts from 2020 through 2022 that caused delays to X-59 aircraft delivery.
NASA increased funding for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions research and studies in AAVP. With
increased scientific and engineering focus, this research could lead to completely eliminating a major
aviation greenhouse gas effect in the relatively near-term.
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS PLANNED FOR FY 2025

ongoing regulatory compliance, and reduction of current and future infrastructure-related risks. In FY
2025, the I&TC Program will:
SAFETY, SECURITY, & MISSION SERVICES
o Maintain the agency’s most critical infrastructure capabilities and assets using condition-based
maintenance to prevent failures and increase operational readiness while maintaining compliance
with environmental and mandatory standards.
o Optimize the agency’s infrastructure portfolio through implementation of the Agency Masterplan
(AMP) processes, including divestment of facilities no longer needed to execute NASA’s mission
thereby reducing future facilities maintenance costs.
o Continue agency efforts to transition to 100 percent Zero Emission Vehicle acquisitions by 2035,
including 100 percent light-duty acquisitions by 2027.
ENGINEERING SAFETY AND OPERATIONS
ESO provides for the management and operations of NASA Headquarters, nine centers, and component
facilities under two programs: (1) Agency Technical Authority (ATA); and (2) Center Engineering,
Safety, and Operations (CESO). Both programs support scientific and engineering activities. They
contribute to the reduction of program risks by ensuring that: technical skills and assets are ready and
available to meet program and project milestones; mission and research endeavors are technically and
scientifically sound; and center practices are safe and reliable, including the highly skilled staff and
specialized infrastructure at the centers that facilitate NASA missions.
• Agency Technical Authority (ATA) provides the foundation for NASA’s system of checks and
balances, defined in NASA’s Strategic Management and Governance Handbook, by providing
independent technical authority over health, safety, and engineering requirements for the missions.
Through independent analysis and deep subject matter expertise, ATA develops policy, designs
procedural requirements, and provides recommendations to NASA's Administrator, mission
directorates, center directors, and program managers, who are ultimately responsible for the safety
and mission success of all NASA activities. In FY 2025, the ATA Program will:
o Work to improve orbital debris environment models, tools, and algorithms to improve orbit
predictions, understand spacecraft anomalies, and better interpret sensor data.
o Continue providing key guidance, testing, and oversight over NASA missions and programs to
ensure health, safety, and stewardship of resources.
• Center Engineering, Safety, and Operations (CESO) ensures NASA's unique, technical, and
innovative capabilities are mission-ready by supporting center-level institutional and technical
capabilities through independent research, development projects, and maintenance of facilities,
laboratories, and other mission-critical assets. CESO fulfills a key component of NASA’s overall
approach to risk management by providing center-level independent technical authority. Center-level
oversight and reporting activities uphold the strategy and guidance from ATAs, putting checks on
safety, engineering, and mission assurance that are separate from mission directorates. CESO funds
NASA HQ operations and center management activities across the agency. Institutional
administration and operational safety programs allow centers the flexibility to address and manage
conditions unique and specialized to their facilities. CESO also ensures that agency policies and
guidance are operationalized across centers with consistency and efficiency. In FY 2025, the CESO
Program will:
o Continue to maintain critical strategic investments in laboratories, technical equipment, and
facilities as aligned with agency goals and objectives in support of all NASA missions.
SAFETY, SECURITY, & MISSION SERVICES
BALANCING SSMS AND CECR
NASA's mission support portfolio is divided between two accounts: SSMS and Construction and
Environmental Compliance and Restoration (CECR). The Mission Support Directorate (MSD) utilizes
both accounts to maintain NASA's critical infrastructure. SSMS and CECR programs are dependent upon
each other and there is a balance between maintenance of assets and infrastructure, repairs and renewal of
failing assets, and the replacement and demolition of obsolete assets. Required maintenance activities
drive SSMS spending decisions, while repairs, renewals (including new construction), and associated
demolition drive CECR spending.
Much of NASA's infrastructure dates back to Apollo-era space exploration. Maintenance activities funded
by SSMS are necessary to prevent costly delays to missions and risks to health and safety. Meanwhile,
failures require immediate repairs and account for an increasing share of the SSMS facilities maintenance
budget. These activities are vital to support evolving mission requirements. SSMS also funds proactive
maintenance initiatives such as Condition Based Maintenance to identify issues and provide lower cost,
scheduled maintenance. Without a sufficient facilities maintenance budget, assets and facilities worsen to
a state requiring CECR funding for more expensive solutions. The increasing deep space exploration
development and testing requirements place an additional strain on NASA's infrastructure and mission-
unique facilities. Both SSMS and CECR activities are vital to support mission infrastructure
requirements. MSD takes an agency-wide approach to make difficult trade-off decisions that ensure
critical capabilities and assets are mission-ready, while also investing in the long-term asset health,
sustainability, and footprint reductions that ensure NASA's future mission success. This approach allows
NASA the ability to prioritize investments in support of long-term asset health, sustainability, and
footprint reductions that ensure NASA's future mission success.
MISSION SUPPORT PRIORITIES
NASA Strategic Plan 2022, Goal 4, directs NASA's mission support functions to enhance capabilities and
operations to catalyze current and future mission success through three key objectives: 1) attract and
develop a talented and diverse workforce; 2) transform mission support capabilities for the next era of
aerospace; and 3) build the next generation of explorers. Functions and capabilities that align to these
three priorities comprise the foundational business that supports NASA activities, including the agency’s
mission goals.
Mission Support’s strategic approach ensures that critical services are mission-ready as requirements
evolve and foundational services are keeping pace with cybersecurity, industry standards, and agency
needs. NASA Mission Support will continue to support the critical capabilities needed for mission
success by staying focused on mission needs, center conditions, and transformational opportunities.
Mission support content is prioritized to achieve the Administration, NASA, and mission support goals
and objectives, to include:
• Workforce, Essential Services, Partners:
o Support mission-critical services that enable NASA's activities and address workforce needs,
including procurement of essential goods and "best-in-class" contracts.
• Critical Infrastructure:
o Conduct vital construction, repairs, and demolition to reduce risk in NASA's infrastructure
portfolio and ensure the right capabilities are mission-ready at the right time.
• Business Transformation:
SAFETY, SECURITY, & MISSION SERVICES
o Introduce technologies and new processes to create strategic cohesion, service resilience, new
efficiencies, and cutting-edge capabilities to enhance how people work and reduce costs
• Cybersecurity
o Strengthen NASA's IT infrastructure, monitoring, detection systems, encryption, cloud security,
and authentication to enhance protection for data and telecommunications.

CONSTRUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND
RESTORATION
Through the Construction and
Environmental Compliance and Restoration
(CECR) account, NASA manages two
themes related to the agency's asset
portfolio: capital repairs and improvements
to NASA's infrastructure, and
environmental compliance and restoration
activities. Activities related to the design,
construction, and demolition of
infrastructure, including utility systems and
facilities, are funded through Construction
of Facilities (CoF). Environmental
compliance, cleanup, and restoration
activities are funded through Environmental
Compliance and Restoration (ECR).
CECR funding enables NASA to address
challenging infrastructure needs. More than
83 percent of NASA's infrastructure is
beyond its design life, posing significant
risk of failure, inefficiency, and potential
impacts to health and wellness. Apollo-era
infrastructure is inefficient and costly to
maintain, as well as insufficient to
accomplish NASA's future missions that
require facilities with leading-edge
capabilities. The agency currently faces a
deferred maintenance backlog of $3 billion,
resulting in unscheduled maintenance that can cost up to three times more than scheduled maintenance to
repair or replace equipment after it has failed. To address these growing challenges, CECR is focused on
modernizing and consolidating NASA’s infrastructure into fewer, more efficient, and more sustainable
facilities, and on repairing and upgrading infrastructure before it has failed.
CECR funding also enables NASA to address its commitment to environmental stewardship by
conducting critical cleanup efforts, maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, and managing
environmental issues. NASA's estimated current environmental liability, excluding asbestos removal that
is not funded by the ECR appropriation, is approaching $2.3 billion and is expected to grow as plans to
address 173 areas of potential concerns for emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
contaminant are developed.
CECR funding ensures that NASA’s assets are ready, available, and appropriately sized to conduct
NASA’s current and future missions, while remaining compliant with the agency and governmental
environmental regulations. This funding is critical to fulfill NASA's 2022 Strategic Plan Objective 4.2 to
"Transform mission support capabilities for the next era of aerospace." CECR programs strive to execute
construction priorities identified in the Agency Master Plan and reduce the agency’s physical footprint
and environmental burden.
The Aerospace Communications Facility at the NASA Glenn
Research Center, completed in 2023, is a state-of-the-art
research facility consisting of efficient, flexible laboratories,
anechoic test chambers, an RF-shielded high-bay space, collab-
oration spaces, information technology support areas, and both
a rooftop and ground-based platforms for communication
antennas. The new facility consolidates more than 80
researchers in over 50 labs located in seven separate buildings
across Glenn’s main campus into one cutting-edge 55,000
square-foot building. Inside the new building, researchers and
scientists will develop advanced communication methods for
use on Earth as well as supporting the agency’s Artemis and
Advanced Air Mobility missions.
